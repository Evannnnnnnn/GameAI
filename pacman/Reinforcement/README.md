# Project 3: Reinforcement Learning

This project implements model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms.

1. **Value Iteration Agent**: It utilizes an MDP and runs value iteration for set iterations before the constructor returns. It implements both asynchronous & prioritized sweeping.

2. **Q-Learning**: A RL agent that learns by trial and error from interactions with the environment through its update(state, action, nextState, reward) method. Approximate Q-learning is also implemented
